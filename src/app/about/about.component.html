    <h2 id="chef-jefferson">Chef Jefferson</h2>

    <p>
    I’m Chef Jefferson – the head chef here at Feed Me, Jefferson!
    </p>

    <p>
    When I met Karen, I took over the responsibility of feeding her; 
    we even went so far as to put it in my wedding vow – “… to love 
    and cherish, to feed and nourish…”
    </p>

    <p>
    It’s usually an easy job – as long as I have cheese and refried 
    beans on hand. Sometimes though, Karen gets a craving and she 
    just doesn’t know what she’s hungry for. I generally ask a bunch 
    of questions – do you want something hot, or cold? Sweet or 
    savory? I always thought it would be easier if there was an app 
    that would help her figure out what she was hungry for though, 
    so that she could just show me.
    </p>

    <p>
    And that’s where our story began…
    </p>

    <h2 id="our-mission">Our Mission</h2>

    <p>
    Our mission is very simple – to keep Karen fed and happy!
    </p>

    <p>
    If it turns out that others can benefit from our mission, so be it.
