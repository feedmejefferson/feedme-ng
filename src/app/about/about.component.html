    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <h2>Chef Jefferson</h2>

    <p>
    I’m Chef Jefferson – the head chef here at Feed Me, Jefferson!
    </p>

    <p>
    When I met Karen, I took over the responsibility of feeding her; 
    we even went so far as to put it in my wedding vow – “… to love 
    and cherish, to feed and nourish…”
    </p>

    <p>
    It’s usually an easy job – as long as I have cheese and refried 
    beans on hand. Sometimes though, Karen gets a craving and she 
    just doesn’t know what she’s hungry for. I generally ask a bunch 
    of questions – do you want something hot, or cold? Sweet or 
    savory? I always thought it would be easier if there was an app 
    that would help her figure out what she was hungry for though, 
    so that she could just show me.
    </p>

    <p>
    And that’s where our story began…
    </p>

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>

    <p>
    Our mission is very simple – to keep Karen fed and happy!
    </p>

    <p>
    If it turns out that others can benefit from our mission, so be it.
    </p>

    <h2>Our App(etizer)s</h2>

    <p>
    Appologies in advance, but you'll have to excuse all of the horrible food puns.
    It's one of the little things that keeps us going. 
    </p>

    <h3><a routerLink="/cb">The Crystal Bowl</a></h3>

    <p>
    Hungry, but not quite sure what you're craving? Why not give our magical Crystal
    Bowl of food a try. <em>Look into our bowl and see what your future holds...</em>
    </p>

    <p>
    Just keep clicking on the food that looks most appetizing (or least unappetizing) 
    to you right now until we think we know what you want. 
    </p>

    <p>
    It's definitely not perfect, but we're still working on it, so keep coming back
    to try again and hopefully it will keep getting better.
    </p>

    <h3><a routerLink="/ff">Food Fight</a></h3>

    <p>
    Not hungry right now? Bored and like looking at food? Maybe food fight is the 
    perfect way for you to pass the time. 
    </p>

    <p>
    We'll choose which foods to pair up for the fight -- you choose the winner. Just 
    click on the food that you think looks yummier (either in general, or based on 
    your current mood). 
    </p>

    <p>
    If you give us your permission, we'll collect your clicks anonymously to 
    build a better map of the food space so that our Crystal Bowl can make better
    guesses about what people are hungry for. 
    </p>
